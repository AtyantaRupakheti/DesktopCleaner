# DesktopCleaner

Overview:
The Desktop Cleaner is a Python application designed to help keep your desktop organized by automatically categorizing files into designated folders such as "Videos," "Documents," "Pictures," and more. This tool was created out of frustration with a consistently cluttered desktop, which made finding important files cumbersome and time-consuming. With this simple yet effective tool, you can ensure that your desktop remains tidy and your files are always easy to find.

Features:
- Automatic Categorization: Automatically sorts files into folders based on the file type.
- Customizable Categories: Easily modifiable categories to suit different file types and personal preferences.
- Simple Setup: Quick and easy installation process--just run the script and watch your desktop organize itself.

Prerequisities:
Before running the Desktop Cleaner, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. I created this for personal use, but if others want it, then I can turn it into executable.
